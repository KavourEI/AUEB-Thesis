# Statistical Models for Natural Language Processing and Topic Modelling using R

## Description
This repository contains the code and documentation for the thesis titled "Statistical Models for Natural Language Processing and Topic Modelling using R." The thesis explores various statistical models and techniques used in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and focuses on their application in topic modeling. The thesis has been created as part of obtaining my second MSc in Applied Statistics in AUEB.
