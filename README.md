# Statistical Models for Natural Language Processing and Topic Modelling using R

## Description
This repository contains the code and documentation for my thesis titled "Statistical Models for Natural Language Processing and Topic Modelling using R." written to obtain my second master's degree in Athens University of Business and Economics). The thesis explores various statistical models and techniques used in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and focuses on their application in topic modeling. The thesis has been created as part of obtaining my second MSc in Applied Statistics in AUEB.
